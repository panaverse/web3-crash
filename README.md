## All Students Should Start Preparing For JavaScript Entry Test

All students are required to start learning JavaScript immediately, even before the program starts. If the number of students who apply for the program are greater than the seats available the applicants will be selected on the basis of JavaScript Quiz scores, which will be take at the start of classes. 

[Watch JavaScript by Zeeshan Hanif to prepare for the Entry Test](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKvqnz8z1zWQdc0NSLknxmxBch5gLOqyo)

Note: You will asked to take a Javascript Entry Test at the start of classes.

## Outcome for Students

The students who graduate from this program will be able to earn $50 per hour, to begin with. This will be a great opportunity for students and professionals of Pakistan.

## Web 3.0 Crash Course

You can think of the stack which we will cover in this course in terms of layers. The first layer is the Web 2.0 technologies which provide the tools to develop 2D frontends and a highly sclable and cost effective cloud backend. The second layer is the Web 3.0 technolgies that is built using the first layer and the Ethererum blockchain. 

[Why You Should Learn Web 2.0 Before Getting into Web 3.0](https://javascript.plainenglish.io/why-you-should-learn-web-2-0-before-getting-into-web-3-0-d251625990db) 


The Web 2.0 full stack applicatios are build using these technologies, this is the first layer of our development stack:

This Web 2.0 stack can be easily extended to develop Web 3.0 Dapps using these technologies, this is the second layer:

1. [Ethereum Blockchain](https://ethereum.org/en/)
2. [Solidity Smart Contract Programming Language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/)
3. [OpenZepllin Smart Contracts](https://www.openzeppelin.com/contracts)

### Blockchain Project 1: Create a Token and Launch ICO/IEO/IDO


As you probably know, the ICO ("Initial Coin Offering") industry has been booming, and it's completely reinventing the way new startups kickstart themselves. In fact, go have a look at [Wikipedia's list of highest crowdfunding projects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-funded_crowdfunding_projects), and you'll notice that blockchain projects absolutely dominate the list.

[Understand the difference between IDO vs. IEO vs. ICO](https://phemex.com/blogs/what-is-a-dex-ido)

[Read how to Lauch an IEO](https://appinventiv.com/blog/how-to-launch-an-ieo/)

Your first task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IEO on the [Binance Launch Pad](https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/94ed108ce89d44ab8602aa3c476dfb04).

Note: Also document the alternatives to Binance Launchpad.

Your second task of the project is to make a google slides presentation on how to start a IDO on the [Polkastarter](https://polkastarter.com/).


Project Part 3: Create a Pako Token

By creating an token and related contracts, you'll also learn how to handle money sent to to your contracts, which should come in handy if you want to create some kind of paid decentralised service in the future.

Therefore, for the sake of this chapter, let's imagine that our  Pako DApp uses its own coin – the Pako Token. We will create two contracts – one for the token itself and one for the token crowd sale (the ICO).

Now Create your own Pako ERC20 Token and deploy it on a testnet. The Token should be to use openzeppelin contracts. You will use Harkhat development envirnoment. Also, write at least 20 automated tests. We will be using the Solidity and Typescript for dvelopment.

Project Part 4: Develop Crowd Sale Contract

This contract will be responsible to allow users to exchange ETH for our Pako Token. In order to do that we need to
Set a price for our token (1 ETH = 100 Pako Token)

Implement a payable buyToken() function. 

Emit a BuyTokens event that will log who’s the buyer, the amount of ETH sent and the amount of Token bought

Transfer 75% the Tokens to the Crowd Sale contract at deployment time. i.e. Right after the contract is deployed, we want the token contract to send 75% of our token supply to it. While 25% remain in our personal "owner" account.

Transfer the ownership of the Crowd Sale contract (at deploy time) to our frontend address so that we are able to withdraw the ETH.

You can use the [openzeppelin crowd sale contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/crowdsales), however you will have to update the code to the latest solidity version.

Also write exentisive tests, for example we will simply send a transaction of 1 ETH from a random account to the contract. After the transaction, we should expect the account to have received Pako, while the contract's balance should have been reduced.

Note: Before you get started writing the token contract we suggest you review [access control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control).

Project Part 5: Trying it with MetaMask

While it's always good to test your code, it's often more satisfying to see the results of your work wrapped in a nice UI. Let's see how we can deploy our contracts and get some Pako tokens into our MetaMask wallet!

We start by running our deployment scripts for the test network so that the new token contracts are uploaded and deployed.

When it's done, take note of what addresses the contracts was uploaded to and copy it!

Now head to MetaMask, and send a transaction of 1 ETH to the crowd sale contract address. If your MetaMask wallet doesn't have any ethers, remember that you can use any faucet.

After the transaction has confirmed, you might be confused about why you can't see any tokens in your wallet. It turns out that you need to manually add the token address in MetaMask in order to "register" it – after all, there are so many tokens out there, there's no way MetaMask could list them all by default!

To do this, open the side menu and click on the "Add token" button to get started:

Once you're on the token page, click on "Add custom token" and paste in the token contract's address in the address field.

After confirming that you want to add the token, you should be able to see your Pako balance right next to your ETH balance in the wallet. How cool!

Project Part 6: Trying it with Multisignature Wallets

[Read](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/10/multisignature-wallets-can-keep-your-coins-safer-if-you-use-them-right/)

Now use [Gnosis Safe]{https://gnosis-safe.io/) with multi-sigs to do what you did in the last part.


Project Part 7: Sending Tokens using Ethers.js 

Write a Typescript program to send Pako Token to some friend's address using Ethers.js.

Project Part 8 Advance: Create, Deploy, Mint, and Sell a NFT

[Read this NFT tutorial series](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/tutorials/how-to-write-and-deploy-an-nft/)

Create a NFT contract using the [OpenZepplen ERC721 NFT Standard](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721).

You may use the [Preset ERC721 contract](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721#Presets).

Deploy your NFT contract on a testnet, mint it, and view it on the MetaMask wallet and list it on [OpenSea Marketplace](https://opensea.io/) for sale.
